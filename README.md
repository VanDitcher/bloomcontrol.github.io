# Bloom Control
eHacks 2022 Bloom Control was a team project I had taken part in during eHacks 2022. Bloom Control is a "tool" used to see where high algae concentrations reside in the great lakes. High algae concentrations have been known to be toxic to both humans and wildlife, the purpose of the website is to provide users with information that could reduce harm.
